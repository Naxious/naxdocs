The spring will start animating towards the target value. You can also set the frequency and damping of the spring. If the frequency and damping are not provided, the spring will use the default values of 1. @param newTarget number | Vector2 | Vector3 -- The target value of the spring. @param frequency number? -- The frequency of the spring. @param damping number? -- The damping of the spring. @return Springer -- The Springer instance.
