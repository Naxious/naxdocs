that allows you to animate values using a spring physics model.\\nThe values you can animate are numbers, Vector2, and Vector3.\\nYou can set the target value, frequency, and damping to customize the spring.\\nYou can also listen to the `onStep` SpringerSignal to get the current value of the spring.\\nWhen the spring reaches the target value, the `onComplete` SpringerSignal will be fired.\\n\\nHere is an example of how to use the Springer class to animate a number from 0 to 1 in 1 second:\\n```lua\\nlocal springer = Springer.new(0, 5, .2)\\nspringer:SetTarget(1, 10, .8)\\nspringer.onStep:Connect(function(value)\\n\\tprint(value)\\nend)\\nspringer.onComplete:Connect(function()\\n\\tprint(\\"Springer completed\\")\\nend)\\n```\\n\\nYou can access all of the properties directly from the Springer instance.\\nIt is recommended to use the `SetTarget` method to animate the spring.\\nSetting the properties directly will not animate the spring.\\nHere is the Springer Class:\\n```lua\\nexport type Springer = {\\n\\tvalue: number | Vector2 | Vector3,\\n\\tvelocity: number | Vector2 | Vector3,\\n\\ttarget: number | Vector2 | Vector3,\\n\\tfrequency: number,\\n\\tdamping: number,\\n\\tspringType: string,\\n\\tisActive: boolean,\\n\\n\\tonComplete: SpringerSignal.SpringerSignal,\\n\\tonStep: SpringerSignal.SpringerSignal,\\n\\n\\tSetTarget: (self: Springer, newTarget: number | Vector2 | Vector3, frequency: number?, damping: number?) -> Springer\\n}\\t\\n```\\n\\n:::note\\n\\tWhen you call the `SetTarget` method, the spring will start animating towards the target value.\\n\\tIf you set any of the properties directly, the spring animation will override them.\\n\\tSetting isActive to false will stop the spring animation.(It will then not call the onComplete signal)\\n\\tSetting isActive to true will NOT start the spring animation. You need to call the SetTarget method to start the animation.\\n:::","source":{"line":132,"path":"libraries/springer/Source/init.lua"}}')}}]);
